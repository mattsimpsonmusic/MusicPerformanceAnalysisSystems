# MusicPerformanceAnalysisSystems

This project has designed a simple monophonic scale trainer using temporal analysis fetures within PureData.

The project takes as inputs a series of pre-designed MIDI files, alongside a MIDI input device, and compares the difference in onset time between 
the two inputs to produce real-time feedback of how the user is performing against a pre-defined tempo.
